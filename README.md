### Project Information
- Dark-mode app is made by using React,
- Theme information is stored in local storage then assigned to a state variable,
- With the help of useEffect, everytime user changes the state variable component re-renders, theme changes and local storage is updated.




------
I used;
- React
- DOM manipulation,
- Local storage, useState, useEffect hooks.





## Lesson Learned

- document.documentElement.className DOM element is quite useful for assigning global styles.
